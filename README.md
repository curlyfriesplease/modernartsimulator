# Intro

This app simulates the frustration of reading the modern art description prose at modern art galleries, particularly the Pompidou Centre.
Update May 2024: This was more amusing before the recent advent of millions of AI sites that do very similar things. This doesn't use AI and was funnier at the time :D

## Setup

.env needs to be added. Copy env.example and add keys for thecatapi and api-ninjas.com
